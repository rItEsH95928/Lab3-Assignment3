    <h2>Panjab University Oral History Project</h2>
    <p>Panjab University today is identified with its beautiful campus in Chandigarh. It was extremely creditable for the post-independence national and state political leadership, civil servants, education administrators and academics alike that the refugee Universityâ€™s goal to recover the glory it had enjoyed before Partition was achieved in a short time. After a decade-long precarious existence, Panjab University moved to its own campus in Chandigarh and professionally rose to match its architectural splendour.

The Panjab University Oral History Project aims to conduct detailed interviews with individuals who have been associated with Early Panjab University (1947-1965) in any capacity. The recorded conversations will be transcribed, copy-edited, annotated and uploaded. Memoirs written by individuals, as also old photographs and documents, would also be published. In addition, we would also publish, or provide link to, other relevant material including photographs. A forum will be provided for conversations. Subsequently, relatively more recent periods would also be covered.</p>
